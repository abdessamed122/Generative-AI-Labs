# Lab 1 - Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue

## Overview

This lab is part of the Coursera course **Generative AI with Large Language Models**.

This lab focuses on dialogue summarization using Generative AI. You will explore how input text influences model output and perform prompt engineering to refine the results. By experimenting with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences, you will gain an understanding of how to guide large language models (LLMs) towards better summarization.

## Objectives

- Understand how generative AI processes and summarizes dialogue.
- Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques.
- Compare zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning for improved results.
- Learn to craft effective prompts to direct LLMs towards the desired output.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Familiarity with Python.
- Access to an API or environment that supports Generative AI models (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Gemini, or Hugging Face models).

## Steps

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Choose a dialogue dataset or create your own conversation samples.
2. **Apply Zero-Shot Summarization**: Feed the raw text to the model without additional context and observe the results.
3. **Experiment with One-Shot Summarization**: Provide a single example to guide the model.
4. **Utilize Few-Shot Summarization**: Use multiple examples to refine the output quality.
5. **Analyze Results**: Compare outputs across different approaches and document findings.
6. **Optimize Prompts**: Modify prompts iteratively to enhance summarization accuracy.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- OpenAI API / Hugging Face Transformers
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how to leverage prompt engineering techniques to improve dialogue summarization. You will also be able to refine prompts to get more accurate and relevant responses from LLMs.
